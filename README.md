# Clock Widget for Windows

Add a clock widget to your PC!

For closing windows it is running a `root.destroy()` and also `os.system('taskkill /im pythonw.exe')`, as a solution to close other previously created widgets if the main one has been closed.

> Note: This version of the project is only running on windows, and has been tested with python 3.11
